Daniel Quigley is a PhD student in the linguistics department at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. Daniel received his Bachelor of Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in May, 2018, setting a record for the number of majors: Physics; Astronomy; Mathematics; Linguistics; Anthropology. He attended Universiteit Utrecht and studied Theoretical Physics, from which he graduated the honors college. 

Daniel's academic interests are in the syntax/semantics interface and machine learning, and his PhD research is ellipsis resolution in natural langauge processing; additionally, Daniel studies Algonquian linguistics, in particular Menominee syntax and semantics. His interests in physics and mathematics are entwined: gravitational physics, diferential geometry, geometric partial differential equations, and geometric flows. Daniel's involvement in anthropology and archaeology included analyses of the Indus Valley Script (an as yet unsolved writing system in South Asia), cultural diffusion and evolution of writing, and the history and development of calendrical systems. Daniel is a teaching assistant for an introductory linguistics course at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, is a freelance mathematics and physics tutor, and is a Genius technician at Apple.

Daniel's ambitions and current projects revolve around exploring frontiers of linguistic and AI research, as well as compiling and writing learning materials for science communication, education, and inclusivity in his areas of interest. He spends much of his time learning, creating, and compiling what he learns and creates in such a way that he intends to be communicated back and presented in such a way that interested parties can use for teaching and learning; to that end, he is trying to be better about documenting those processes, and this site will be a place to summarize and provide updates on those projects.

title: Grammar

**Conlanging** refers to the creation process of **constructed languages** or **conlangs**. Examples of constructed langauges include: Esperanto, Quenya, Dothraki, Lojban, or Klingon. A person who creates or constructs a language is a **conlanger** or **language creator**. The **Language Creation Society** is the premier commuinity for language creators, and [their site](https://conlang.org/) is a hub for conlangers, would-be conlangers, those interested in or curious about conlangs, and anything else to do with conlanging.

## Goals

Creating languages is my creative outlet. In an effort to digitize and document my creative works, I have begun to write comprehensive reference grammars and grammatical sketches for each. This serves the following purposes:

1. Document my creative works, and in a circular way, create for the sake of it. Language creation is an art, and is my principle creative outlet.
2. Explore linguistic features of world langauges. Language creation is an innovative way to encounter grammatical processes of world languages and read relevant linguistics literature in the process of devising mechanics for the created language. Documenting these features as they are relevant to the constructed language can in turn be used as teaching materials for the interested reader.
3. Turn these grammatical descriptions into useful resources for other langauge creators. Essentially, these grammars are meant to be exhaustively detailed to be available for language creators and be used as reference for linguistic phenomena.
