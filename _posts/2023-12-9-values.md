_“The first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings.”_ -- Albert Schweitzer

The content of this post follows from an outline submitted for review to the [Global Forum on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence 2024](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics). The argument here follows from the assumption that moral and ethical obligations of artificial intelligence are not inherent, and that AI agents are a kind of moral _tabula rasa_; the onus of ensuring ethical and moral developments of technology and artificial intellegence falls upon the social setting whithin which they are developed, advocating for cooperation between humanities and STEM focused disciplines.

The question follows: To what extent can technological advancements (including, but not limited to, existing AI systems) be described as having consistent values or goals? 

I will frame my response to the prompt in three parts: (1) an answer; (2) some problems with the answer; (3) solutions to those problems. Existing AI systems are consistent with their values and goals only insofar as they reflect the values and goals of their societal context, and are therefore a _tabula rasa_; this leads to challenges in consistent values and goals due to moral relativism and the varying norms of the different groups that commission, design, and present such systems; a solution to this issue follows from **emergent ethics and values** through large-scale inclusion, diversity, and interdisciplinary integration. These points are restated below:

1. Answer to the prompt: AI as _tabula rasa_, so the onus falls on the societal context and people working on it to ensure consistent values and goals.
2. The problem with the above is moral relativism; that is, assuming a blank slate, _whose_ values and goals are to be ascribed?
3. A possible solution to the problem: ethics, values, and morals as _emergent_; that is, as natural consequences of large-scale inclusion, diversity, and integration.
