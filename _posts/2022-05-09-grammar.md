**Conlanging** refers to the creation process of **constructed languages** or **conlangs**. Examples of constructed langauges include: Esperanto, Quenya, Dothraki, Lojban, or Klingon. A person who creates or constructs a language is a **conlanger** or **language creator**. The **Language Creation Society** is the premier commuinity for langauge creators, and [their site](https://conlang.org/) is a hub for conlangers, would-be conlangers, those interested in or curious about conlangs, and anything else to do with conlanging.
