title: Epistemology, the Philosphy of Science, and the Scientific Method
---

_“Science is a way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, predictive and reliable - a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it, that is empowering and emotional.”_ -- Brian Greene

Modern empirical science is founded on **epistemology**, the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues. Epistemology asks the question: how do we know what we know?

Like any foundational account of complex concepts like knowledge, belief, rationality, and their appropriate justifications, we have to base our philosophy on some concepts we take at face value. Much of the information here follows from class notes, Michael Kohlhase's lecture notes on Logic-Based Natural Language Processing (see [here](https://kwarc.info/teaching/LBS/notes.pdf)), the ever-verbose Stanford Encyclopdia of Philosophy (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/)), and the Integration and Implementation Insights post on epistemoglogy (see [here](https://i2insights.org/2021/09/21/epistemology-and-integrative-research/)). This post builds to a formal statement of the scientific method.

## Propositions & Observations ##

We express belief, knowledge about the world, attitudes, and phenomena using _language_. That _language_, however, is otherwise agnostic to how the world, the universe, and everything else operates; the universe does not much care what we have to say about it. Truth, then, is only accessible by _observation_, which itself can be fallible. Yet, these are the tools with which we have to work, so we begin with a series of working definitions.

* **Epistemology** is the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues.
* A **proposition** φ is a sentence about the actual world or a possible world. The meaning of a proposition φ can have a truth value (true or false) in the actual world or in a possible world. 
* A **belief** is a proposition φ that an agent _a_ holds true about a possible world, regardless of its truth value in the actual world.
* **Knowledge** is justified, true belief; that is, **knowledge** is a proposition φ that an agent _a_ holds true about a possible world and is true in the actual world.

Suppose we have an agent _a_ that believes φ in a possible world _w_. The truth value of a proposition φ in _w_ can be determined by observation. Our agent _a_ experiences that φ is true in _w_ or conducts a deliberate, systematic experiment that determines φ to be true in _w_. By this observation or experiment, _a_ no longer just believes that φ is true, but also has knowledge that φ is true.
