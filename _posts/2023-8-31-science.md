_“Science is a way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, predictive and reliable - a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it, that is empowering and emotional.”_ -- Brian Greene

Modern empirical science is founded on **epistemology**, the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues. Epistemology asks the question: how do we know what we know?

Like any foundational account of complex concepts like knowledge, belief, rationality, and their appropriate justifications, we have to base our philosophy on some concepts we take at face value. Much of the information here follows from class notes, Michael Kohlhase's lecture notes on Logic-Based Natural Language Processing (see [here](https://kwarc.info/teaching/LBS/notes.pdf)), the ever-verbose Stanford Encyclopdia of Philosophy (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/)), and the Integration and Implementation Insights post on epistemoglogy (see [here](https://i2insights.org/2021/09/21/epistemology-and-integrative-research/)). This post builds to a formal statement of the scientific method.

## Propositions, Observations, and Experiment ##

We express belief, knowledge about the world, attitudes, and phenomena using _language_. That _language_, however, is otherwise agnostic to how the world, the universe, and everything else operates; the universe does not much care what we have to say about it. Truth, then, is only accessible by _observation_, which itself can be fallible. Yet, these are the tools with which we have to work, so we begin with a series of working definitions.

* **Epistemology** is the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues.
* A **proposition** φ is a sentence about the actual world or a possible world. The meaning of a proposition φ can have a truth value (true or false) in the actual world or in a possible world. 
* A **belief** is a proposition φ that an agent _a_ holds true about a possible world, regardless of its truth value in the actual world.
* **Knowledge** is justified, true belief; that is, **knowledge** is a proposition φ that an agent _a_ holds true about a possible world and is true in the actual world.

Suppose we have an agent _a_ that believes φ is true in a possible world _w_. The truth value of a proposition φ in _w_ can be determined by observation. Our agent _a_ experiences that φ is true in _w_ or conducts a deliberate, systematic experiment that determines φ to be true in _w_. By this observation or experiment, _a_ no longer just believes that φ is true, but also has knowledge that φ is true.

We enumerate this as the following:

1. An agent _a_ belives φ to be true in _w_
2. An agent _a_ determines the truth value of φ by observation or experiment
3. An agent _a_ has knowledge that φ is true if the truth value of φ by observation or experiment is true

##  Reproducibility, Phenomena, and Counterexamples ##

This is all well and great, except for what was warned above: observation can (and often is) fallible. One observation by one observer is hardly evidence, and credibility of such an observation is often taken skeptically. Indeed, our agent may well observe some φ to be true, when it actuially is false, or false when it is actually true!

The solution invokes the principles of probability: repeat the observations enough times such that we increase the probability of true observation. In other words, collect data. This gives us two new definitions:

* An observation of a proposition φ is **reproducible** iff φ can be observed by different observers in different situations or contexts.
* A **phenomenon** is a proposition φ that is reproducibly observable to be true in a class of worlds.

We add the following to our enumeration:

4. An agent _b_, an agent _c_, and agent _d_ belives φ to be true in _w_
5. An agent _b_, an agent _c_, and agent _d_ determine the truth value of φ by observation or experiment
6. An agent _b_, an agent _c_, and agent _d_ have knowledge that φ is true if the truth value of φ by observation or experiment is true
7. Because agent _a_, agent _b_, agent _c_, and agent _d_ have observed φ in different situations or contexts, φ is reproducible

Our agent _a_, agent _b_, agent _c_, and agent _d_ would like to verify whether the φ is a phenomenon by observing it in a class of worlds, or even all worlds. However, there may be too many such worlds or the worlds may be too large to make this a practical exercise. Our agents have a secret weapon: a counterexample.

* A **counterexample** to a proposition φ is a particular world or worlds _w_ such that φ is observably false in that world or worlds _w_.

A counterexample alleviates the labor for observing a proposition φ in all and every world _w_. Instead, the absence of counterexamples is the best our agents can hope for in general for accepting phenomena. We continue our enumeration.

8. agent _a_, agent _b_, agent _c_, and agent _d_ observe φ to be true in a class of worlds
9. φ is a phenomenon because it is reproducibly observable to be true in a class of worlds, and no counterexamples are found; if a counter example is found in _w_, then φ is not a phenomenon

It is impossible/inefficient for our agents, however, to know _all_ phenomena; our agents can only retain a (small) subset of known propositions from which all phenomena can be derived.  The (small) subset of propositions from which the phenomena that are relevant to an agent can be derived will become the beliefs of the agent. An agent will attempt to justify these beliefs, and hence, knowledge.

## Explanations and Hypotheses ##

Suppose now that our agents not only observe that φ is a phenomenon, but also there is another observation ψ which seems to be true whenever φ is true.

* A proposition ψ **follows from** a proposition φ, iff ψ is true in any world where φ is true.

Now that out agents have this observation, we want them related.

* An **explanation** _E_ of a phenomenon φ is a set of propositions, such that φ follows from _E_.

Adding to our enumeration:

10. agent _a_, agent _b_, agent _c_, and agent _d_ observe that whenever φ is true, ψ is true; ψ follows from φ
11. φ is a phenomenon following from a set of propositions, for which our agents now have an explanation

We prefer explanations Φ that explain more than just φ (that is, more evidence). Recall, however, that it is not a practical exercise to exhaust all possible propostions or worlds. We extend this notion to explanations in the following way:

* A proposition is **falsifiable** iff counterexamples are theoretically possible and the observation of a reproducible series of counterexamples is practically feasible.
* A **hypothesis** _h_ is a proposed explanation of a phenomenon that is falsifiable.

We insist that a hypothesis be falsifiable, because we cannot hope to verify it and indeed the absence of counterexamples is the best we can hope for. But if finding counterexamples is hopeless, it is not even worth bothering with a hypothesis. This gives rise to a very natural strategy of accumulating propositions to represent knowledge about the world.

12. Because our agents have an explanation _E_ of a phenomenon φ such that each element of _E_ is falsifiable, our agents have a hypothesis

## Scientific Theories ##

Falsifiability is the key here, not least of all because of the availability of resources, but also to work towards a coherent and verifiable system of explanations and predictions. Indeed, the strategy follows: collect hypotheses about the world, drop those with counterexamples and those that can be explained themselves (trivial hypothesis are not useful tools for explanation or prediction). These culminate into a scientific theory.

* A hypothesis _h_ can be **tested** in a world _w_ by observing the value of _h_ in _w_.
* If the value of _h_ in _w_ is true, then the observation **supports** _h_; if it is false, then the observation **falsifies** _h_.
* A **scientific theory** for a set Φ of phenomena is a set _H_ of hypotheses that:
  * has been tested extensively and rigorously without finding counterexamples.
  * is **minimal**: no subset of _H_ explains Φ.
* Any proposition φ that follows from a theory Φ is a **prediction** of Φ.

To falsify a theory Φ is remarkably efficient: it is sufficient to falsify _any_ prediction becayse any observation of a prediction φ of Φ supports Φ. We can conclude our enumeration, then, as the following:

12. Our agents repeatedly observe the values of _h_ in _w_ to be true, so those values support _h_
13. Armed with multiple such hypotheses, our agents continue to test and do not find counterexamples
14. Our agents define their set of phenomena to be a scientific theory, from which they can make predictions

Indeed, the epistemological approach is the predominant approach in modern science.
