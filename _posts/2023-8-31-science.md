title: Epistemology, the Philosphy of Science, and the Scientific Method
---

_“Science is a way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, predictive and reliable - a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it, that is empowering and emotional.”_ -- Brian Greene

Modern empirical science is founded on **epistemology**, the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues. Epistemology asks the question: how do we know what we know?

Like any foundational account of complex concepts like knowledge, belief, rationality, and their appropriate justifications, we have to base our philosophy on some concepts we take at face value. Much of the information here follows from class notes, Michael Kohlhase's lecture notes on Logic-Based Natural Language Processing (see [here](https://kwarc.info/teaching/LBS/notes.pdf)), the ever-verbose Stanford Encyclopdia of Philosophy (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/)), and the Integration and Implementation Insights post on epistemoglogy (see [here](https://i2insights.org/2021/09/21/epistemology-and-integrative-research/)). This post builds to a formal statement of the scientific method.

## Propositions, Observations, and Experiment ##

We express belief, knowledge about the world, attitudes, and phenomena using _language_. That _language_, however, is otherwise agnostic to how the world, the universe, and everything else operates; the universe does not much care what we have to say about it. Truth, then, is only accessible by _observation_, which itself can be fallible. Yet, these are the tools with which we have to work, so we begin with a series of working definitions.

* **Epistemology** is the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues.
* A **proposition** φ is a sentence about the actual world or a possible world. The meaning of a proposition φ can have a truth value (true or false) in the actual world or in a possible world. 
* A **belief** is a proposition φ that an agent _a_ holds true about a possible world, regardless of its truth value in the actual world.
* **Knowledge** is justified, true belief; that is, **knowledge** is a proposition φ that an agent _a_ holds true about a possible world and is true in the actual world.

Suppose we have an agent _a_ that believes φ is true in a possible world _w_. The truth value of a proposition φ in _w_ can be determined by observation. Our agent _a_ experiences that φ is true in _w_ or conducts a deliberate, systematic experiment that determines φ to be true in _w_. By this observation or experiment, _a_ no longer just believes that φ is true, but also has knowledge that φ is true.

We enumerate this as the following:

1. An agent _a_ belives φ to be true in _w_
2. An agent _a_ determines the truth value of φ by observation or experiment
3. An agent _a_ has knowledge that φ is true if the truth value of φ by observation or experiment is true

##  Reproducibility and Phenomena ##

This is all well and great, except for what was warned above: observation can (and often is) fallible. One observation by one observer is hardly evidence, and credibility of such an observation is often taken skeptically. Indeed, our agent may well observe some φ to be true, when it actuially is false, or false when it is actually true!

The solution invokes the principles of probability: repeat the observations enough times such that we increase the probability of true observation. In other words, collect data. This gives us two new definitions:

* An observation of a proposition φ is **reproducible** iff φ can be observed by different observers in different situations or contexts.
* A **phenomenon** is a proposition φ that is reproducibly observable to be true in a class of worlds.

We add the following to our enumeration:

4. An agent _b_, an agent _c_, and agent _d_ belives φ to be true in _w_
5. An agent _b_, an agent _c_, and agent _d_ determine the truth value of φ by observation or experiment
6. An agent _b_, an agent _c_, and agent _d_ have knowledge that φ is true if the truth value of φ by observation or experiment is true
7. Because agent _a_, agent _b_, agent _c_, and agent _d_ have observed φ in different situations or contexts, φ is reproducible

Our agent _a_, agent _b_, agent _c_, and agent _d_ would like to verify the phenomenon φ by observing it in a class of worlds, or even all worlds. However, relevant world classes may be too large to make this a practical exercise.
