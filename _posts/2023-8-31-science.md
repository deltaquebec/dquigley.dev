title: Epistemology, the Philosphy of Science, and the Scientific Method
---

_“Science is a way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, predictive and reliable - a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it, that is empowering and emotional.”_ -- Brian Greene

Modern empirical science is founded on **epistemology**, the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues. Epistemology asks the question: how do we know what we know?

Like any foundational account of complex concepts like knowledge, belief, rationality, and their appropriate justifications, we have to base our philosophy on some concepts we take at face value. Much of the information here follows from class notes, Michael Kohlhase's lecture notes on Logic-Based Natural Language Processing (see [here](https://kwarc.info/teaching/LBS/notes.pdf)), the ever-verbose Stanford Encyclopdia of Philosophy (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/)), and the Integration and Implementation Insights post on epistemoglogy (see [here](https://i2insights.org/2021/09/21/epistemology-and-integrative-research/)). This post builds to a formal statement of the scientific method.

## Propositions & Observations ##

We express belief, knowledge about the world, attitudes, and phenomena using _language_. That _language_, however, is otherwise agnostic to how the world, the universe, and everything else operates; the universe does not much care what we have to say about it. Truth, then, is only accessible by _observation_, which itself can be fallible. Yet, these are the tools with which we have to work, so we begin with a series of working definitions.

* **Epistemology** is the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues.
* A **proposition** φ is a sentence about the actual world or a class of worlds deemed possible in a natural or formal language whose meaning can be expressed as being true or false in a specific world.
* A belief is a proposition φ that an agent a holds true about a class of worlds. This is a characterizing feature of the agent.
* Knowledge is justified, true belief.

So we will never be able to ascertain the “true belief” part, and need to work all the harder on the “justified” part.

How can an agent justify a belief to obtain knowledge.

Given a world w, the observed value (or just value, i.e. true or false) of a proposition (in w) can be determined by observations, that is an agent, the observer, either experiences that φ is true in w or conducts a deliberate, systematic experiment that determines φ to be true in w
