title: Epistemology, the Philosphy of Science, and the Scientific Method
---

_“Science is a way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, predictive and reliable - a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it, that is empowering and emotional.”_ -- Brian Greene

Modern empirical science is founded on **epistemology**, the branch of philosophy concerned with studying nature of knowledge, its justification, the rationality of belief, scientific theories and prediction, and various related issues. Epistemology asks the question: how do we know what we know?

Like any foundational account of complex concepts like knowledge, belief, rationality, and their appropriate justifications, we have to base our philosophy on some concepts we take at face value. Much of the information here follows from class notes, Michael Kohlhase's lecture notes on Logic-Based Natural Language Processing (see [here](https://kwarc.info/teaching/LBS/notes.pdf)), the ever-verbose Stanford Encyclopdia of Philosophy (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/)), and the Integration and Implementation Insights post on epistemoglogy (see [here](https://i2insights.org/2021/09/21/epistemology-and-integrative-research/)). This post builds to a formal statement of the scientific method.

## Propositions & Observations ##

The crucial intuition here is that we express belief and possibly knowledge about the world using language. But we can only access truth in the word by observation, a possibly flawed operation. So we will never be able to ascertain the “true belief” part, and need to work all the harder on the “justified” part.
