### Current Role

I'm a PhD student at the [Linguistics Department](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/), advised by [Nicholas Fleisher](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/people/fleisher-nicholas/). My research bridges the fields of linguistics, computer science, and mathematics. I specialize in:
- Theoretical linguistics
- Human language technologies
- Human-computer interaction

I specialize in advancing natural language processing (NLP) by merging causality and machine learning theory. My work is centered on equipping semantic vector space models with logical reasoning, thereby increasing their interpretability while maintaining efficiency. By integrating model-theoretic semantics into vector spaces, I bridge traditional logical models with modern NLP techniques. This integration aims to ensure our models are not only efficient but also trustworthy and transparent in their decision-making processes.

Besides my research, I serve as the Instructor of Record for introductory linguistics courses at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Outside academia, I'm a freelance mathematics and physics tutor and a Genius technician at Apple.

### Educational Background

- **PhD in Linguistics**: University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee (Ongoing)
- **MA in Linguistics**: University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee
- **MSc Honors College Certificate in Theoretical Physics**: Universiteit Utrecht
- **BSc with Majors in**: Physics, Astronomy, Mathematics, Linguistics, and Anthropology - University of Wisconsin-Madison. Proud to have set a university record with this quintuple major.

### Research and Work Experience

- **Physics**: Collaborated with the late Stefan Westerhoff on:
  - The [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) at the South Pole.
  - The [High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)](https://www.hawc-observatory.org/) in Mexico, under the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center.
  
- **Linguistics**: Contributed to the [Texts for Teachers](https://news.wisc.edu/partnership-to-save-menominee-language-offers-new-resources-for-language-teachers/) project. Together with [Monica Macaulay](https://monicamacaulay.com/), our team focused on the documentation, revitalization, and preservation of the Menominee language.
  
- **Anthropology**: Assisted [J. Mark Kenoyer](https://www.anthropology.wisc.edu/staff/kenoyer-j-mark/) in the Anthropology department, conducting statistical analyses of the Indus Valley Script.
