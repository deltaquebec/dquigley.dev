Born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I have deep Midwestern roots. My journey took me to Madison for my undergraduate years, and then, craving a change of scenery and culture, I packed my bags and headed to the Netherlands for my Master's certificate. Although the Netherlands was an incredible adventure, Milwaukee called me back, and I returned home for my PhD.

I am a cinéaste and contend that were things different, I might have become a filmmaker. I enjoy collecting books as much as reading them, and attempt science fiction and fantasy creative writing every now and again, and much of my time is spent in a café, bookstore, or bookstore café.
