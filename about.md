Born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I have deep Midwestern roots (and the accent to match). I studied physics, astronomy, mathematics, linguistics, and anthropology at UW-Madison for my undergraduate years, and I lived in the Netherlands during my Master's certificate at Universiteit Utrecht. I am now again home in Milwaukee for my PhD at UW-Milwaukee.

I am a cinéaste and contend that were things different, I might have become a filmmaker. I enjoy collecting books as much as reading them, and attempt science fiction and fantasy creative writing every now and again. Much of my time is spent in a café, bookstore, or bookstore café.

I believe that technical expertise without translation is lost knowledge. Or, pretentiously:

- _Scientia technica sine translatione perit_
- _Technisches Fachwissen ohne Übersetzung ist verlorenes Wissen_
- _L'expertise technique sans traduction est un savoir perdu_

Every effort should be made to practice good scientific communication, making knowledge accessible and available. I believe in openness and in free and open access to education and educational materials.
