Born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I have deep Midwestern roots (and the accent to match). I studied [physics](https://www.physics.wisc.edu/), [astronomy](https://www.astro.wisc.edu/), [mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/), [linguistics](https://langsci.wisc.edu/), and [anthropology](https://www.anthropology.wisc.edu/) at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), for which I set a record for the number of majors. I lived in the Netherlands during my Master's certificate at [Universiteit Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/). I am now in Bloomington, Indiana as a postdoc at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/) after finishing my PhD at [UW-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/).

I am a cinéaste, and contend that were things different, I might have become a filmmaker. I enjoy collecting books as much as reading them, and attempt science fiction and fantasy creative writing every now and again. Much of my time is spent in a bookstore, a café, or a bookstore café.

I believe that technical expertise without translation is lost knowledge. Or, pretentiously:

- _Scientia technica sine translatione perit_
- _Technisches Fachwissen ohne Übersetzung ist verlorenes Wissen_
- _L'expertise technique sans traduction est un savoir perdu_

Every effort should be made to practice good scientific communication, making knowledge accessible and available. I believe in openness and in free and open access to education and educational materials.
