Besides my research, I serve as the Instructor of Record for introductory linguistics courses at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Outside academia, I'm a freelance mathematics and physics tutor and a Genius technician at Apple. I am a cin√©aste and contend that were things different, I might have become a filmmaker. I enjoy collecting books as much as reading them, and attempt science fiction and fantasy creative writing every now and again.
