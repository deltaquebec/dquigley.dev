### [ˈdæn.jəl ˈkʰw̥ɪɡ.li]

I'm a PhD student at the [Linguistics Department](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/), advised by [Nicholas Fleisher](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/people/fleisher-nicholas/). My research bridges the fields of linguistics, computer science, and mathematics.

In particular, I specialize in advancing natural language processing (NLP) by deriving, describing, and exploring fundamental linguistic and mathematical theory. My work is centered on equipping semantic vector space models with logical reasoning, thereby increasing their interpretability while maintaining efficiency. By integrating model-theoretic semantics into vector spaces, I bridge traditional logical models with modern NLP techniques. This integration aims to ensure our models are not only efficient but also trustworthy and transparent in their decision-making processes.

Besides my research, I serve as the Instructor of Record for introductory linguistics courses at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Outside academia, I'm a freelance mathematics and physics tutor and a Genius technician at Apple. I am a cinéaste and contend that were things different, I might have become a filmmaker. I enjoy collecting books as much as reading them, and attempt science fiction and fantasy creative writing every now and again.
