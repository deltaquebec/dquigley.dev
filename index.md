I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/) at the [Center for Possible Minds](https://www.possibleminds.org/). My research is interdisciplinary, and involves aspects of linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. I work on problems of semantics, meaning representation, reasoning, and abstraction. 

Prior to my work at Indiana, I was a PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/) [Linguistics Department](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/), advised by [Nicholas Fleisher](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/people/fleisher-nicholas/), in which I specialized in mathematical linguistics, especially in natural language semantics, coincident with natural language processing (NLP), logic, and category theory.

Outside academia, I am a technical advisor for [Obviate AI](https://www.obviate.ai/); additionally, I am contracted with [Eruditis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eruditis/) as a machine learning scientist.
