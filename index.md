I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/) at the [Center for Possible Minds](https://www.possibleminds.org/). My research is interdisciplinary, and involves aspects of linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. I work on problems of semantics, semiotics (specifically, writing systems), meaning representation, reasoning, and abstraction. 

Prior to my work at Indiana, I was a PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/) [Linguistics Department](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/), advised by [Nicholas Fleisher](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/people/fleisher-nicholas/), in which I specialized in mathematical linguistics, especially in natural language semantics, coincident with natural language processing (NLP), logic, and category theory. 

In my undergraduate at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), I was involved in documentation, elicitation, and formatting stories in Menominee, both at the Menominee Reservation and in the lab with [Monica Macaulay](https://monicamacaulay.com/). I worked with [J. Mark Kenoyer](https://www.anthropology.wisc.edu/staff/kenoyer-j-mark/) on the 
[Indus Valley](https://www.harappa.com/) Script, in which I studied writing as evident on pottery sherds, deomonstrating different sign frequencies relative to other written artifacts. In the physics department, I worked with the late Stephan Westerhoff on the [HAWC](https://www.hawc-observatory.org/) experiment, a part of [WIPAC](https://wipac.wisc.edu/), in which I worked on various hardware projects, contributed to IceCube-Gen2, and resolved discrepencies in gamma-ray observations across [HAWC](https://www.hawc-observatory.org/), [MAGIC](https://www.iac.es/en/observatorios-de-canarias/telescopes-and-experiments/magic-telescopes), [VERITAS](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/), and [H.E.S.S.](https://hess-experiment.eu/) observatories.





Outside academia, I am a technical advisor for [Obviate AI](https://www.obviate.ai/); additionally, I am contracted with [Eruditis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eruditis/) as a machine learning scientist.
