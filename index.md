### [ˈdæn.jəl ˈkʰw̥ɪ.ɡli]

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/) [Linguistics Department](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/), advised by [Nicholas Fleisher](https://uwm.edu/linguistics/people/fleisher-nicholas/). My research is interdisciplinary, and involves aspects of linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science.

My graduate research specializes in mathematical linguistics, especially in natural language semantics. My work is coincident with natural language processing (NLP), logic, and category theory.

I serve as the Instructor of Record for introductory linguistics courses at the [University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/), and I have a position as a Research Assistant in the [Electrical Engineering](https://uwm.edu/engineering/departments/electrical-engineering/) department on a causal AI project with [Jun Zhang](https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/zhang-jun/) and [Shuaiqi (Roger) Shen](https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/shen-shuaiqi-roger/). Outside academia, I'm a freelance data and machine learning scientist; I am currently contracted with [Eruditis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eruditis/).
